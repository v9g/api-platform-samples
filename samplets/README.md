# Apigee Edge API Proxy Samplets

## What are samplets?

* Samplets are API proxies that you can run on Apigee Edge that demonstrate one or two targeted features of a policy.
* Samplets try to answer the question: how the does this policy *really* work?
* Samplets are easy to modify and redeploy -- quickly see the effects when you change a policy's configuration.
* Samplets are intentionally simplistc, and are intended to demonstrate one or two features of a single policy.
* Some samplets demonstrate how multiple policies work together for very targeted use cases.
* Samplets supplement policy documentation and are usually tied to examples in the documentation.

## How to use samplets

Apigee Edge proxy samplets are easy to deploy and run:

1. Clone the `api-proxy-samples` Git repo to your local system. This repo includes a `samplets` folder.
2. cd to the `samplets folder`.
3. cd to the folder containing the samplet you wish to deploy. For example:

    `cd Extract-Variables`

4. In an editor, open `../../setup/setenv.sh` and enter the information for your Apigee Edge organization. This config file is used by the deploy script to deploy the samplet to your org.
5. Execute the `deploy.sh` script. You may have to change the file permission to allow you to execute it the first time. For example:

    ```
    chmod 755 deploy.sh
    ./deploy.sh
    ```

6. Run the samplet with the `invoke.sh` script. For example:

    ```
    chmod 755 invoke.sh
    ./invoke.sh
    ```

> **Tip:** You can also use an API tool like Postman to execute the APIs.

## Sample output

The invoke script calls the samplet proxies one by one, and returns a response that includes information about what the samplet accomplished. For example:

```
API 1 of 2: http://docs-test.apigee.net/extract-variables/resource1/123456
Press Return to call this API...
{"Feature demonstrated":"Extract value of {id} parsed from the proxypath.suffix: /extract-variables/resource1/{id}.","Data extracted":"123456","Policy demonstrated":"Extract Variables","Flow variable written/read":"urirequest.id"}

API 2 of 2: http://docs-test.apigee.net/extract-variables?code=abc123
Press Return to call this API...
{"Feature demonstrated":"Extract value of {dbncode} parsed from query param: /extract-variables?code=DBN{dbncode}.","Data extracted":"abc123","Policy demonstrated":"Extract Variables","Flow variable written/read":"queryinfo.dbncode"}
```

* Examine the deployed proxy in the Edge UI
* Use the Edge Trace Tool to see your proxy in action
* Change the inputs to the API to see changes reflected in output
